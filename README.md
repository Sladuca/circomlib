# Groth16 Benchmark

## Description

- Contains a circuit [`sha256_2_x16`](https://github.com/Sladuca/circomlib/blob/sha2x16-test/circuits/sha256/sha256_2_x15.circom) which instantiates 15 instances of the standard `circomlib` circuit `sha256_2`.

This respository contains 3 folders:
- `circuits`: it contains the implementation of different cryptographic primitives in circom language.
- `doc`: it contains some circuit schemes in ASCII (must be opened with Monodraw, an ASCII art editor for Mac).
- `test`: tests.
